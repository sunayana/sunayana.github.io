For over 15 years, I've been driven by a conviction that **mathematics, computing, and thoughtful engineering can be powerful forces for positive change**.

As a Senior Software Engineer with a PhD in Computational Geometry, I recently completed an intensive chapter at **[CarbonSpace](https://carbonspace.tech)** (Dublin-headquartered, remote — 2023–February 2026), where I helped build a satellite-based platform for monitoring **Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE)** — the balance of CO₂ absorbed and released by ecosystems.

I designed and built **ML pipelines** that fused satellite imagery ([Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov)) with meteorological and soil data to predict carbon fluxes across diverse land cover types. This included architecting cloud-native **data ingestion pipelines** using [Zarr](https://zarr.dev) and [STAC](https://stacspec.org) for reproducible, lineage-tracked geospatial workflows — from raw satellite scenes through to ML-ready data cubes. On the infrastructure side, I implemented **AWS Batch** workflows for data ingestion, training, and inference along with the team, and enforced **hexagonal architecture** across the platform to keep scientific logic decoupled from cloud infrastructure.

The impact: a modern, extensible ML platform capable of estimating carbon exchange at farm and forest scale — supporting CarbonSpace's mission to make carbon monitoring transparent and verifiable.

Before CarbonSpace, I was a key contributor at **[Cervest](https://cervest.earth)**, where I co-architected a global **riverine and pluvial flood risk system** at 90 m resolution. I built the core flood inundation model in Julia, created Julia bindings for the C++ [RichDEM](https://github.com/Cervest/richdem) library for pluvial modelling, and applied performance engineering techniques (DiskArrays, memory-mapped I/O, Zstandard compression) that made global-scale processing feasible. The work spanned flood hydrology, Bayesian statistics, and distributed computing on Kubernetes. [Read more →](/work/cervest-flooding/)

## What Drives Me

I believe **technology should serve humanity**. Whether designing memory-efficient algorithms for large-scale climate data, implementing scientific accuracy in CO2 monitoring systems, or volunteering with [Solve for Good](https://solveforgood.org) and [World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org), I'm motivated by applying rigorous engineering to problems that matter.

## My Expertise

My work spans **Big Data**, **Computational Geometry**, **Image Processing**, **Geospatial Computing**, and **Healthcare Technology**. I bring a passion for translating complex scientific research into well-designed, high-performance software.

I've built:
- 3D point cloud processing algorithms for surgical navigation
- Julia wrapper for RichDEM's Fill-Spill-Merge C++ algorithm, used for pluvial flood modeling at Cervest
- Containerized data pipelines for climate intelligence (Argo Workflows, Pachyderm, AWS Batch)
- ML platforms with hexagonal architecture and domain-driven design
- CAD toolkits for medical device manufacturing

Through systematic code review, architectural patterns, and platform modernization initiatives, I help teams build systems that are not just functional—but maintainable, scalable, and scientifically rigorous.

## Looking Forward

I'm currently open to new opportunities in **software engineering projects with high social impact**, particularly in interdisciplinary environments where curiosity, continuous learning, and collaboration are valued as much as technical excellence.

If you're working on challenges at the intersection of:
- **Climate & Environmental Tech**
- **Geospatial Intelligence**
- **Machine Learning & Scientific Computing**
- **Healthcare Technology**

**I'd love to connect.**
